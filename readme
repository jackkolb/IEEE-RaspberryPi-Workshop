This is the missile launch system!
Be careful with it!

It works by hosting a webserver
in Python that allows the user
to activate the missile, set a
target, and confirm the launch.

The target is stored in the file
"target", and the html files are
in the "templates" folder.

The launch system is started
using a bash file (run.sh) that
simply runs the python script
"webserver.py".

Make sure this doesn't go offline!

You never know when the nuclear war
will strike...
